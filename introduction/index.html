              <p>My name is Matt Layton and I am from Kaysville, UT. I am a Web Design and Development major with an emphasis in Development.
                This is my second to last semester before I graduate (This semester being the last semester of classes and the next for an
                internship which I am still looking for). I decided last year to switch from majoring in the Professional Pilot degree at
                Utah State University to Web Development and have loved every minute of this new change. I am hoping to find a job as a
                Web Developer or similar here in the Salt Lake area. I have taken courses that have included languages such as Java, PHP,
                JavaScript, HTML and CSS along with the database class which included Oracle and MySQL. Also, I have taken a course in
                Graphic Design, Web Business and Visual Media. I am very excited for this class and hope to gain experience that will benefit
                me greatly in the Web Development field.</p>
              <p>For the past three semesters I have been taking classes on campus, but decided to take this semester online so I can work
                and because I will be getting married in July. I am a little nervous for this new transition into online classes, but also
                excited for the new experience.</p>
              <p>My hobbies include movies, mountain biking, snowboarding and swimming. In the summers I work at a landscaping company and
                in the winters I work as a snowboard instructor at Snowbasin Ski Resort. I have also done volunteer work as a Web Developer
                for the Idaho Association for Marriage and Family Therapists.</p>
